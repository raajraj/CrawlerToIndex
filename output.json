Breach UCnet Home News Working at UC Compensation Benefits Tools Services Search Accellion Breach Frequently asked questions Protect yourself Substitute Notice of Data Breach News archive Substitute Notice of Data Breach May 10 2021 updated May 21 2021 To the UC community As we recently disclosed in communications to students employees and their dependents and retirees the University of California UC was recently subject to a cybersecurity attack involving its Accellion file transfer appliance FTA This post provides up to date information on what happened and what we are doing What Happened On December 24 2020 UC s Accellion FTA was the target of an international attack where perpetrators exploited a vulnerability in the application Over 100 organizations were similarly attacked including universities government agencies and private companies In connection with the attack certain UC data was accessed without authorization We identified on March 29 2021 that some of this data was posted on the Internet After the University discovered the issue we took the system offline and patched the Accellion vulnerability We are in the process of transitioning to a more secure solution The University is cooperating with the FBI and working with external cybersecurity experts to investigate this matter and determine what happened what data was impacted and to whom the data belongs There is no evidence that other University systems were impacted To inform and protect the UC member community the University notified the community via email hosted interactive workshops at several campuses and posted information about the event and how individuals can protect themselves to its websites The University also arranged for free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for employees current and former and their dependents retirees and beneficiaries and current students through Experian IdentityWorks Between May 12 and May 14 2021 these individuals received an email from Experian on behalf of the University reminding them about the available services and providing a unique activation code The University has established a dedicated call center to answer questions regarding the event and these services What Information Was Involved While the investigation is ongoing evidence shows that an unauthorized third party gained access to files that contain personal information relating to members of the UC community including employees current and former and their dependents retirees and beneficiaries and students as well as other individuals who participated in UC programs The impacted information may include full names addresses telephone numbers Social Security numbers driver s license information passport information financial information including bank routing and account numbers health and related benefit information disability information and birthdates as well as other personal information provided to UC Information provided by students who participated in the 2020 University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey UCUES was also impacted and posted to the internet by the threat actor We are also separately notifying certain individuals whose UC applications were impacted For individuals that submitted applications for admission to the 2020 21 school year their responses to questions in their application were impacted For individuals that started or submitted applications for the 2021 22 school year their name email address and phone number were impacted Notifications for these individuals will contain information pertinent to them What We Are Doing The University is working to identify and contact the community members whose personal information was impacted These investigations take time and we are working deliberately while taking care to provide accurate information as quickly as we can By mid July we expect to send through Experian appropriate individual notifications to those people whose personal information was impacted where current contact details are available to the University In addition to implementing a new file transfer system with enhanced security controls we are deploying additional system monitoring broadly throughout our network conducting a security health check of certain systems and enhancing security controls processes and procedures We are also reviewing and updating our security policies procedures and controls What You Can Do If you have already enrolled in the free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services with Experian you do not need to re enroll For eligible UC community members that have not registered for these services information about how to register was contained in the update email sent between May 12 and May 14 2021 We request that UC community members remain vigilant against threats of identity theft or fraud You can do this by regularly reviewing and monitoring your account statements and credit history for any signs of unauthorized transactions or activity If you ever suspect that you are the victim of identity theft or fraud you can contact your local police Additionally it is also always a good idea to be alert for phishing emails or phone calls requesting sensitive information such as passwords Social Security numbers or financial account information These requests often come from a sender pretending to be a company you do business with or a person you know We also recommend that you use multifactor authentication for your online accounts when offered We have also established a dedicated call center available toll free in the U.S at 866 904 6220 from 6 00AM to 8 00PM PT on Monday through Friday and from 8 00AM to 5 00PM PT on Saturday and Sunday Members of the UC community

enroll Additional Information To protect against possible fraud identity theft or other financial loss you should always remain vigilant review your account statements and monitor your credit reports

FRAUD ALERT OR SECURITY FREEZE You may contact the three major credit bureaus at the addresses below to place a fraud alert on your credit report A fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a possible victim of fraud A fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit Instead it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised and requires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit Although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for the credit it might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name In addition to a fraud alert you may also consider placing a security freeze on your credit report A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer s credit report without written authorization However please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay interfere with or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans credit mortgages employment housing or other services A credit reporting agency may not charge you to place temporarily lift
